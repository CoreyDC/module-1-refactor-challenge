# Module 1 Refactor Challenge Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage by refactoring starter code provided by UT bootcamp. The code contained both HTML and CSS code. I built this project to solve certain issues with the code syntax. I learned how to use semantic HTML elements by replacing all of the div elements in the original code. This made the HTML more readable by both the user and the browser. I also consolidated all the CSS to optimize the DRY principal. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage 

To use this webpage you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) and see my HTML and CSS code as it currently makes up the webpage. Or you can visit the original repository for this webpage at https://github.com/the-Coding-Boot-Camp-at-UT/UTA-VIRT-FSF-PT-11-2022-U-LOLC/tree/main/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge, and my repository at https://github.com/CoreyDC/module-1-challenge, and compare the HTML and CSS files to see exactly how I refactored the code. I also put notes in each file describing exactly what I did. 

As for the webpage itself, it is a mock site for a marketing agency. You can scroll through each individual section to read about them. Furthermore, there is a navigation menu on the top right of the page that will take you to the scetion you wish to view.
